#  Deep Generative Endmember Modeling: An Application to Unsupervised Spectral Unmixing    #

This package contains the authors' implementation of the paper [1].

In order to address endmember variability in spectral unmixing, the endmember spectra are modelled using a deep generative model (a VAE), which is learned from the observed hyperspectral image. This allows us to parametrize the variable endmembers using points in the low-dimensional latent space of the generative models, which can then be simultaneously optimized with the abundances to solve the unmixing problem.
